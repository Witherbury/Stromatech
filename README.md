Coding backed by calculated experiments will never fail. Growing plants, observing them, noting down their traits, studying their characteristics and workingt owards generating more effective biological features.

# Gene Sequencing Techniques
There are various techniques that can be employed in order to sequence DNA. 


# The Maxam Gilbert Technique
The first method, known as the Maxam Gilbert method, was developed in 1977.\
It was not an effective way of sequencing DNA, however.\
In MGS, DNA extraction was, inevitably, the first step. The DNA is then denatured to give single stranded DNA. The phosphate (5P') at the end of the DNA is removed and labelled. An enzyme called phosphatase removes the phosphate from the DNA, and simultaneously, the kinase adds the 32P to the 5' end of it.\

4 different chemicals are used to cleave DNA at four different positions; hydrazine and hydrazine NaCl are selectively attack pyrimidine nucleotides while dimethyl sulfate and piperidine attack purine nucleotides.\

Hydrazine: T + C\
Hydrazine NaCl: C\
Dimethyl sulfate: A + G\
Piperidine: G\

An equal volume of 4 different ssDNA samples is taken into 4 different tubes each containing 4 different chemicals. The samples are incubated for some time and electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The scalability of MGS is poor, and that makes it harder to use.\
