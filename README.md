Coding backed by calculated experiments will never fail. Growing plants, observing them, noting down their traits, studying their characteristics and working towards generating more effective biological features.

# The Problem
Drought is one of the most prominent abiotic stresses in the world. Increase in drought leads to decrease in crop yield. Many processes have been formulated in order to induce drought tolerance in crops. However, these methods are extremely time consuming and cost intensive. They seem to have efficacy but lack efficiency. There are, however, a few advanced techniques that scientists employ. 

# Techniques Already In Use
One of them is Marker Assisted Breeding. It uses DNA markers associated with desirable traits in the presence of abiotic stress. Another method is Quantitative Trait Loci. These are regions of the genome  at which genetic variation is associated with a particular quantitative trait. QTL, however, does not always return precise or accurate data. 

# The Benefit
If more drought tolerant crops can be propagated, it would benefit farmers around the world, especially in underdeveloped nations. It could possibly help in improving the amount of yield or even the quality of yield. Consequently, debts would reduce. And in turn, farmer suicides will decrease. A breakthrough in biotechnology can have a significant positive impact on society. This example illustrates the importance of a topic that everyone usually ignores. 

# The Task At Hand
But how can drought tolerance be induced in crops? How can more efficient and accurate methods be utilized? Now, when a plant senses that there is a lack of water in it's environment, it counters it with 2 types of responses. These can be long term responses or short term responses. Short term responses include osmotic regulation, decreased carbon assimilation, closure of stamatal pores and hydraulic changes. Some long term responses are turgor maintenance, carotenoid degradation, inhibition of shoot growth and intervention of osmoprotectants and ROS-scavenging enzymes. It can be inferred that the plant will do everything it can in order to survive harsh drought-like conditions. But how can this ability be improved?
